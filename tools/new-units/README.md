# new-units

Purpose: the lane workflow, gates without Gradle, counts, renders and in-game check of the "new units" step: fourteen
unit kinds drawn by eight parallel design lanes (2026-10-18).
Batch: `documentation/2026-10-15-custom-equipment-rendering/` (`NEW_UNITS_PLAN.md`, `NEW_UNITS_SURVEY_*.md`,
`NEW_UNITS_REVIEW.md`). None of this was ever tracked (`tools/` is git-ignored); nothing was removed from a tracked path.

## Contents
- `KIT.md`: the brief every lane worked from: the unit frame (y 0 = grade, front at -z), nozzle and pipe-spacing rules,
  collision solids, decks, ladders, the stair primitive, moving parts, determinism, budgets (60k quads aim, 80k ceiling).
- `check.sh <lane> <KIND[,KIND]> <source files...>`: a lane's gate without Gradle. Compiles the lane's designs into
  `build/tmp/units/<lane>/out` against the last Gradle build, runs `ProcessUnitTest`, `ShapeRasterizerTest`,
  `LineGeometryTest` and `DeterministicMathSourceTest` through `TestRunner`, then `UnitCounts` for the lane's kinds.
  Run from a worktree root after `./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava` built the scaffold once. Several lanes can
  share one worktree this way while no Gradle run is allowed.
- `render.sh <lane> <KIND> <size> <length> <support> <name> [views]`: software render (`UnitRender`) of one unit to
  `build/tmp/units/<lane>/render/<name>-<view>.png`; views front, back, left, right, top, iso, iso2, iso3, low.
- `UnitCounts.java`: per kind at its smallest, middle and largest size and second size: box, shell and interior cells,
  chunk quads, moving parts, nozzles, layout time. `TestRunner.java`: a JUnit 5 runner without the platform launcher
  (the API jars from the Gradle cache).
- `lang-merge.js <en_us.json> <entries.json>...` and `lang/*.json`: each lane's keys, merged into the lang file line by
  line (an `@after` map anchors new keys; a flat key goes after the last key of its group). Order used: `scaffold`,
  then the eight lanes.
- `INTEGRATION.md`: the lanes' hand-backs: nozzle-face maps (now strict in `ProcessUnitTest`), kit gaps, owner choices,
  counts.
- The kit consolidation (2026-10-18, `KIT_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`, `KIT_CONSOLIDATION_REVIEW.md`): `KIT_API.md` (the kit's
  index after it), `CONSOLIDATION_LANES.md` (the eight migration lanes' results, kit gaps and owner choices),
  `INTEGRATION_BRIEF.md` and `INTEGRATION_REPORT.md` (the single-writer step that folded the lanes' copies into the kit),
  `RenderAll.java` (min, mid and max size of each kind, `RenderAll <out dir> <views> [KIND...]`).
- `probes/`: `SceneProbe` (default second size, support and box of the in-game scene's picks), `LangProbe` (every key a
  unit's constructor rows, held line, datasheet and roles ask for, and its `%s` count), `MoveProbe` / `MoveDiff` (the
  moving-part area check that found the rod-end disc on a block face), `TextFit` (constructor and datasheet text widths
  in the vanilla font, the estimate `UnitTextTest` gates), `LineCount` (most datasheet lines per kind), `Sweep` (every size, length and support of the named kinds through the walk
  and climb, pipesApart and free pipe block checks, with each shape's quads; `sweep.sh <name> <kinds...>`, its class path
  in the script) and `Dump` (every nozzle and moving part of the dumped shapes, to diff before and after a change). Package
  `com.wormzjl.createcheme.science.equipment`; from a worktree root after a build:
  `javac -cp build/classes/java/main -d build/tmp/probe/out <file>`, then
  `java -cp "build/tmp/probe/out;build/classes/java/main;build/resources/main" com.wormzjl.createcheme.science.equipment.<Name>`.
- `in-game/`: the bridge-lane check on a fresh world (`tools/custom-equipment-rendering-poc/new-world.sh`, vanilla
  `runMcpClient` lane, `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`): `scene-a.txt` (eight smaller kinds at z 0), `scene-b.txt` (six large
  kinds at z 70), `scene-constructor.txt`, `view-*.txt` and `aim-*.txt`, helpers `view.js`, `shoot.sh`,
  `UnitProbe.java` (boxes and moving-part pivots), `Diff.java` (pixel change between captures), `lang-check.js`; the
  recheck after the fixes is `r-*` (scene, views, aims, shots). Shots in `shots/`; batch copies are shots 126–137.
  The kit consolidation's check is `k-*` (`KIT_IN_GAME_REPORT.md`): `k-scene-c.txt` and `k-scene-c2.txt` after scenes
  A and B, `k-reshoot.sh` (an old `view-<name>.txt` to `shots/k-<name>.png`), `k-shoot.sh` (`k-view-*.txt`),
  `k-boxes.txt`, probes `KSceneProbe`, `KBoxProbe`, `KNozzleProbe` (package as above) and `KDiffMap` (old, new and
  changed pixels in one picture; default package).
- `logs/`: `new-units-gates-2026-10-18.tar.gz` (the four Gradle gate runs, the end-rail gate proof, the counts after
  the lanes and after the fixes), `new-units-check-2026-10-18.tar.gz` and `new-units-recheck-2026-10-18.tar.gz` (client
  and Gradle console logs of the two in-game checks), `new-units-kit-check-2026-10-18.tar.gz` (the kit check's client
  and Gradle console logs and the reshoot pixel diffs), `kit-consolidation-2026-10-18.tar.gz` (the kit consolidation's Gradle gate run and test
  XML, the combined lane check, counts before and after the integration, sweep outputs).
- `review/` (2026-10-18, the owner's review world): `review-scene.txt` (35 structures in five rows with signs: drums and
  columns, the eight older units, the fourteen new units at their middle size, the rest and largest cases; written by
  `probes/ReviewScene.java`), `overview.png`. Built through the bridge lane on a fresh superflat world, saved with Save
  and Quit, copied to `run/saves/Equipment review 2026-10-18` (LevelName renamed in `level.dat`), spawn at 20 -60 -14.

## Old-save refresh and FCC proportions (2026-10-18)
- `in-game/COMPAT_IN_GAME_REPORT.md`, `COMPAT_RECHECK_REPORT.md`: the two bridge-lane checks of the old-save equipment refresh
  (`SAVE_REFRESH_REVIEW.md`) on copies of the owner's review world; `compat-*` and `recheck-*` command files, views, shoot scripts
  and shots; `Pair.java` (side-by-side shots) and `Dark.java` (near-black pixel count); logs in
  `logs/save-refresh-2026-10-18.tar.gz` (the three Gradle gate runs and the recheck's client log).
- `fcc-proportions/`: the FCC prototype (forms A and B), its probe, the fixed-scale renderer and the montage tool; see its README.
