# Sight-glass direction verification

Batch: `documentation/2026-10-25-sight-glass-flow-direction/`.

Implementation `e5591c04`, branch `codex/sight-glass-flow-direction`. 25 focused tests pass, package generation succeeds. Protocol `sight-glass-3`; no process persistence change or game run. `verification.json`, `results/` and compressed `logs/` retain evidence. `preview/flow-direction.gif` shows 56 frames with 12 configurations.

`run.ps1 -SourceRoot <compiled-owned-worktree>` compiles the retained Java2D native-geometry preview and draws opposite horizontal/vertical flow, front/back windows and a top window using production bubble paths. `assemble.py` builds an animated sheet. Java2D approximates game shading; no game, saved world, input automation or solver is used.

Focused qualification: `gradlew test --tests '*SightGlassDisplayTest' --tests '*PhysicalFluidTopologyTest' jar --max-workers=4 --console=plain`, with client closed. Logs/XML remain local and are compressed under `logs/`. No tracked probe was detached, no Gradle task/gate/exclusion changed, and no removing/re-attachment patch applies.
