/**
 * The one numerical box of the thermodynamics, 10 to 6000 K and 1 Pa to 1 GPa (owner decision of 2026-10-16, plan
 * {@code RANGE_EXTRAPOLATION_PLAN} section 4, option A of decision 8). Leaving a property's data range never holds a
 * state: every model continues past its data. The box is where the mathematics stops being trusted at all, far from
 * play (liquid nitrogen at 63 K is six times its floor, the reference spines reach 6000 K, 1 GPa is a hundred times a
 * package envelope's 10 MPa): a trial state outside it is refused with a plain {@link IllegalArgumentException}, so a
 * Newton step or a substep backtracks, and the equilibrium engine's searches stay inside it. A committed state outside
 * it would be a solver defect, a numerical failure, never a data-range hold.
 *
 * <p>The box bounds every temperature and pressure a model reads, a component's partial pressure among them (the
 * hydrocarbon partial pressure a network vapour is evaluated at, an unknown of its own): up to the same 1 GPa, and down
 * to {@link #MINIMUM_PARTIAL_PRESSURE}, the partial pressure's own floor, since a trace in a gas that is nearly all steam
 * stands far below the 1 Pa of a state (1e-6 of a gas at 1 bar: 0.1 Pa).
